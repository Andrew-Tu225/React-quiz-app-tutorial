Simple Quiz App in react

This is the first react app I built by watching the youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OqiKTyH4r0. 
This project gives me the ability to understand the core of React, including functional component and hooks, and use these skills to build the interactive application.

    Score tracking

    Question-by-question navigation

    Option to restart the quiz

    Simple and responsive layout
